    "Here I create the Wizard class. A wizard is a type of creature and inherits the creature class. It is initialised in the same way as the creature class but with different default values. These values are used to initialise a creature when a wizard is created. The wizard also has a variable for mana and arcana.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's string magic method is the same but adds the Mana and Arcana values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the creature methods, the wizard class has methods for recharge, fire bolt, heal, mass heal, and fire storm. It also has a variation of the attack method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attack method is the same as the creature method but also tops up the wizards mana by 20. It only adds the whole 20 if the current mana plus 20 is less than or equal to the max mana of 100. Otherwise it tops up mana to the max of 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recharge method tops up a wizard's mana points by 30. Like the attack method, it only adds the whole 30 if the current mana plus 30 is less than or equal to the max mana of 100. Otherwise it tops up mana to the max of 100. If mana is already at the maximum of 100, it prints a message saying mana is full.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fire bolt method is a form of attack. A random number is generated from 1 to 20, determining the attack roll. If greater than the combination of the target's defence and speed, the attack hits. The damage is determined by a combination of the wizard's attack value, a randomly generated number from 1 to the wizard's current arcana value, and half of the wizard's current arcana value. If the attack hits, the wizard gains 10 mana. These 10 mana are applied with the same rules as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heal method allows the wizard to heal another creature. The wizard needs at least 20 mana to perform a heal. The heal amount is determined by a random number between 1 and 8, plus half of the wizard's current arcana value. If the heal will push a creature's health points beyond their max health points, their health is just restored to maximum. If a wizard has insufficent mana, a message is printed identifying how much mana they are short.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass heal method works similar to the heal method but takes a list of creatures as an argument. Rather than healing one creature, it heals all of the creatures in the list. The heal amount is determined by a random number between 1 and 10, plus the wizard's total current arcana value. The cost of mass healing is 30 mana. When it comes to a wizard's current mana levels, the same restrictions as the heal method apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fire storm methods works similar to the fire bolt method. It is a form of attack, but instead of attacking a single target, it takes a list of creatures as an argument and attacks them all at once. A fire storm costs 50 mana to execute and causes one of two levels of damage to each creature. The lower level of damage is determined by a random number between 1 and 20 plus the wizard's speed value. The higher level of damage is determined by a random number between 5 and 20 plus the wizard's current arcana value. If the lower level damage value is greater than or equal to the wizards current arcana value, the lower level damage is applied, decreasing the health points of a creature by that value. Otherwise, the higher level damage is applied. The fire storm level and damage value is determined for each creature independently, meaning some creatures could be hit with a full fire storm and others with a mini. If a wizard has insufficient mana to execute a fire storm, a message is printed detailing how much mana they are short."

    "Here I create the battle class which simulates a battle between the allies and the enemies. By initialising the battle class we create a team of enemies and a team of allies. The enemies are represented in the enemies list and include a Goblin King, an Orc General, two Goblins, and two Orcs. The allies are represented in the allies list and include two archers and two fighters. A wizard object is created to represent the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "The battle class has four methods, auto_select, select_target, player_turn, and start.\n",
    "\n",
    "The auto select method is used by creatures during battle to randomly select a target from the opposing team. The method takes a list of creatures as it's argument. It checks the life of each creature in the list, adding creatures that are alive to the healthyTargets list. The final target object is then selected from the healthyTargets list. This means that only an alive creature can be selected as the target. The method returns the target object, which is then used as the argument in a creature's attack method. If no creatures in the list are alive, the method returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "The select target method is used by the wizard (player) to select a creature to attack or heal during battle. It takes a list of creatures as it's argument. It prints the list of creatures, detailing the index, name, health points, and max health points of each. Using a while loop, an index number is requested from the player. If the input is outside the index range, the program prints an error message and asks the player for input again. This will continue until the player provides an input within the index range. Once the player provides an accepted input, the target name is printed and the method returns the target object. The target object is then used as the argument in a wizard action method (attack, fire bolt, heal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every four rounds the player gets to take a turn. The player turn method determines how that turn functions. When the method is called it prints the player name, health points, max health points, and mana. It then prints the name, health points, and max health points of each ally, and a list of possible actions. Using a while loop, input is requested from the player. If the input doesn't match any of the possible actions, an error is printed. This is repeated until an acceptable input is given. Once an acceptable input is given, the selected action is printed, if neccessary, a target is selected using the select target method, and the required action method is called. The loop is then broken with a break statement. If the player decides to quit, the method returns 1. This value is used to trigger an exit mode in the start method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The start method is used to begin the battle. It begins by determining the order in which creatures will take their turn. Fastest creatures go first. To set the order I created a dictionary called order and filled it with all of the creatures in the enemies and allies lists. The keys were creature objects. The values were the creature's speed value. I then used a lambda function to order the list by the values. Reverse = True returns a list in ascending order. To set no limit on the number of rounds, I set round = 1, and run the code while round > 0. The round starts by printing the round number, and then, using a for loop, it iterate through each creature in the dictionary. It first check that they are alive. If they are, it checks if they are an ally or an enemy. Based on this, it uses the auto select method to select a target. If the auto select method returns None, this means that an entire team has been killed and the opposing team has won. When this happens, a message indicating the winners is printed. A game over condition is also triggered, printing a message and a list of creatures that were killed. If there are alive creatures to choose from, the creature's turn method is called with the round number and target object. After the turn is complete, the target's life is checked. If it's 0, it has been killed and a message is printed to that effect. The names of killed creatures are appended to a list called 'dead'. This list of names is displayed at the end of each round. This process repeats for each creature in the dictionary. Once every alive creature has taken a turn, the round is complete. At the end of a round, if a team has not won, a message is printed indicating the end of the round, along with a list of creatures killed thus far. The round variable increments by 1 and a new round begins. Every 4 rounds, the player turn method is called allowing the player to interact in the battle."
